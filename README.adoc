= Don't Install Postgres, use `docker run postgres` !!!

== Overview

We all love Postgres (nee PostgreSQL), but installing and maintaining a native installation on 
your operating system of choice is a pain. Instead, let 
link:https://www.docker.com[Docker] take care of the details for you.

== Setup

Make sure you have docker installed on your computer.  You should be able to do the following on the
command line:

```bash
> docker --version
Docker version 20.10.7, build 20.10.7-0ubuntu1~20.04.2
```

You should not have to use `sudo` to make the above work.
If it fails, please see 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29101043/cant-connect-to-docker-from-docker-compose[this page on StackOverflow.com]

== Usage

Kick off a local version of Postgres running in Docker via:

```bash
> ./pg-start.bash
c406d9cb25f1f57025620ac32d97707eef6f11b44e763d853dad03a7a015b5e5    # <= Docker container ID
```

All Postgres files will be saved locally under your home directory in:

    $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres

You can stop the Postgres container by typing:

    > ./pg-stop.bash        # or just type:  docker stop pg-docker  

Feel free to look inside the two Bash scripts to see the details.

== Interact with the Postgres DB via PSQL:

```pre
  > psql-start.bash
  psql (14.0 (Debian 14.0-1.pgdg110+1))
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=# select version();
                                       version                                                           
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   PostgreSQL 14.0 (Debian 14.0-1.pgdg110+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit
  (1 row)

  postgres=# exit
```

You can also give PSQL command line arguments to the script:

```pre
> psql-start.bash --version 
psql (PostgreSQL) 14.0 (Debian 14.0-1.pgdg110+1)

```

or

```
> psql-start.bash  --list
                                 List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(3 rows)
```

== Next Steps

The above scripts invoke the latest version of Postgres in a container with the default password
(`"docker"`). This is a great way to get started for exploration of Postgres, and also a great
way to run unit tests!  For production use, of course, you'll need to use a more secure
installation with a different password and a more permanent location for Postgres to store it's DB
files.
